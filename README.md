# Integrating-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-for-Early-Detection-of-Glaucoma
This project presents a novel approach for early detection of glaucoma through the integration of  machine learning algorithms. Utilizing deep learning techniques, the study focuses on disc and cup  segmentation in fundus images, a critical step in identifying glaucoma. The proposed algorithm consists of two stages: optic disc region detection and optic disc and optic cup segmentation. Initially, a U-Net network is employed to detect the optic disc region, followed by a multilabel network for joint segmentation of the optic disc and optic cup. The segmented regions are then analyzed to calculate the optic disc and cup ratio, which serves as a crucial indicator for detecting glaucoma. This approach offers a promising method for early diagnosis of glaucoma, potentially leading to timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.
